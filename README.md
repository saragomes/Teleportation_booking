Teleportation_booking
=====================

The year is 2092 people are using teleportation instead of taking planes, boats or cars.

You're an engineer at the company Blue Origins that manages a limited number of teleporters.

A teleporter -- which looks like an elevator, can only be used by 3 people in the same time.

Your mission is to design a reservation system for people to book a place in a teleporter.

The resevation system should allow people to choose a departure point and a destination point and see if any teleporters are available.

If a teleporter is available, a person should be able to reserve a place by entering his/her name. 

If a teleported is busy, since is 2092 and there are no privacy issues, anyone should be able to see the names of the persons who reserved the teleporter.

Blue Origins does not allow waste, so a person could register only one place in the teleporter with his/her name.
